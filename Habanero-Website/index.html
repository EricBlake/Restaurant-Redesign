					<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
					<p>This Restaurant has been in the Ibarra family for over 20 years. We moved from Eastern Oregon to continue the legacy and our dream of owning this Mexican restaurant. And for over 10 years we have been making the best Mexican food in Austin. With a dedicated and talented group of employees that have been with us from that start 10 years ago, we strive to make the most authentic, freshest Mexican food in town. We would not be here without our great customers. So for that we thank you and welcome you to experience the taste of real Mexican food at great prices.</p>
